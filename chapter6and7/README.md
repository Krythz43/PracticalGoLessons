### Number systems and usage

I am kinda okay at these stuff so skipping these (binary octal hexadecimal and all)

If you want to represent a number in hexadecimal in your code, add 0x before the numeral 


Convertions can be done with %d to decimal
fmt.Printf("Decimal : %d\n", n2)


Unicode has 6 power 4 possibilities
